# About Me

I’m Alexandros Tsalapatis, a software engineer dedicated to improving myself just 1% each day. This site serves as a platform to showcase some implementations that I’ve found interesting and worth sharing. I want to emphasize that my code and understanding are not perfect—better solutions may exist, and I encourage everyone to explore those. The more code you read, the better code you’ll write.

This website is a space for me to document ideas that captivate me, helping me understand them better and remember the nuances I discover along the way. Some concepts are straightforward and easy to grasp, while others are more complex and, therefore, more intriguing.

Over the past five years of my coding journey, I’ve often turned to the work of other engineers for inspiration when I encounter bugs or challenges. It’s my turn now to give back and assist others with the solutions I’ve developed.

I don't have a strict posting schedule—perhaps I will post regularly, or perhaps not. What matters to me is providing detailed insights into the software solutions I genuinely enjoy creating.

Thank you for valuable time, and I hope you find the solutions you’re looking for in my posts!
### My Interests

What I enjoy most coding about:
- **Clean Code ( S.O.L.I.D. )**: I consistently strive to apply best practices and design patterns in my code, ensuring meaningful naming conventions for methods and components.
- **Java/Spring boot**: Building efficient back-end systems and web applications.
- **Unreal Engine**: Developing immersive gaming experiences.

### Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out to me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandros-tsalapatis-100070233/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Source-Code-Wizard) profiles. I’d love to connect and discuss exciting opportunities or collaborate on projects!

Thank you for visiting my page!
