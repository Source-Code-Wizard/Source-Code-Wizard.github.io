I’m **Tsalapatis Alexandros**, a software engineer dedicated to improving myself just 1% each day. This site serves as a platform to showcase some implementations that I’ve found interesting and worth sharing. I want to emphasize that my code and understanding are not perfect—better solutions may exist, and I encourage everyone to explore those. The more code you read, the better code you’ll write.

This website is a space for me to document ideas that captivate me, helping me understand them better and remember the nuances I discover along the way. Some concepts are more straightforward and easy to grasp, while others are more complex and, therefore, more intriguing.

Over the past six years of my coding journey, I’ve often turned to the work of other engineers for inspiration when I encounter bugs or challenges. It’s my turn now to give back and assist others with the solutions I’ve developed.

I don't have a strict posting schedule—perhaps I will post regularly, or perhaps not. What matters to me is providing detailed insights into the software solutions I genuinely enjoy creating.

Thank you for your valuable time, and I hope you find the solutions you’re looking for in my posts!

### My Areas of Interest in Coding :
- **Clean Code ( S.O.L.I.D. )**: I consistently strive to implement best practices and design patterns in my code while ensuring meaningful naming conventions for methods and components. This approach aims to make my programs intuitive and easily understandable. Finally the end goal is **always**
  to write code that is as extensible as possible while being resilient to bugs and poor design choices.
- **Java/Spring boot**: Building efficient back-end systems and web applications.
- **Unreal Engine**: Developing immersive gaming experiences.

  For the time being at least, these areas encapsulate what I enjoy most about coding.
